SeoAgency is a prototype of a commercial website that was developed as part of the Full-Stack Software Development Course at the Code Institute. The primary objective of this project was to create a foundational website that, with specific enhancements, could be fully utilized in a professional setting.

The core purpose of the commercial website is to attract clients. It features key sections such as Services and a Price List. The Services page is designed to generate leads; clicking on any service directs users to a contact form. This form not only records inquiries in a database but also optionally interacts with a CRM system, facilitating seamless customer relationship management.

The Price List page focuses on a main offering: SEO support for online projects. It allows users to view different service packages, choose one, and subscribe via a sandboxed PayPal integration, demonstrating the site's e-commerce capability. Additionally, the site includes a subscription form powered by [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io)  in email testing mode, ensuring reliable email delivery testing during the development phase.

Future plans for the project include deploying it on a real domain, expanding the Services page to enhance client trust through a portfolio page, and integrating a chatbot for immediate communication with potential customers. This approach aims to solidify SeoAgency as a robust tool for businesses seeking effective online presence management.
